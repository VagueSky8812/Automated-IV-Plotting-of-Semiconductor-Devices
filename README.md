# Automated-IV-Plotting-of-Semiconductor-Devices

For ID vs VD plots of the NMOS, connect the supply to the drain through a 30Ohm or similar resistor in series, not directly, to get finer points in the linear region. Do specify the R_D in the code
For ID vs VG plots, you can connect the nmos terminals directly to the supply - no crucial artifact will be lost in this case.
